  work perfectly in both light and dark themes.

  **Application Name:** ExpenseTracker

  - Secondary Gray: #3b3b3b (charcoal gray) - use for secondary text and subtle elements
  - Accent Green: #b7ec42 (bright lime green) - use for highlights, call-to-action elements, and financial symbols
  - Background: White/light colors for contrast

  **Dark Theme Colors:**
  - Primary Light: White or light gray - for main text and elements (inverted from light theme)
  - Secondary Light: Light gray - for secondary elements
  - Accent Green: #b7ec42 (bright lime green) - remains the same vibrant accent color

  - Modern, clean design with subtle gradients using: #b7ec42 to #9dd632
  - Should work as both horizontal layout (logo + text) and icon-only version

  - Scalable from 16px (favicon) to large sizes (headers, marketing)

  **Style Direction:**
  - Fintech/financial app aesthetic - trustworthy and professional
  - Minimal, clean design - not overly complex
  - Gradient effects using the green accent colors
  - Rounded corners and modern shapes
  - Should convey: trust, efficiency, smart technology, financial growth

  **Deliverables Needed:**
  - Main logo (horizontal with text)
  - Icon-only version (for app icons, favicons)
  - Both light and dark theme variations
  - Ensure the accent green (#b7ec42) pops against both light and dark backgrounds
